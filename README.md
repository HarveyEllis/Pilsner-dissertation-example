# Pilsner-dissertation-example
This is a simple example of the PILSNER framework by Pete Dodd in action. 
This particular instance has been run as a package which must be built to be run in Rstudio.
A more versatile version of PILSNER is currently under construction [here](https://github.com/HarveyEllis/pilsner)
